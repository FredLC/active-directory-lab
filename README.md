<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project's goal is to replicate a mini corporate environment using Active Directory. The lab consists of one Windows Server 2019 machine and a Windows 10 Pro client. The lab was created in Oracle VirtualBox. Future iterations of this project will utilize Microsoft Azure instead (or a combination of local and cloud using Azure AD Connect). A PowerShell script was also integrated to automate and facilitate user creation. The Windows Server machine will act as both a Domain Controller, DHCP server, Remote Access Server and default gateway.
